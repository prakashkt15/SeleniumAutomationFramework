# E-commerce Selenium Test Automation Framework

## Overview

This Selenium-based test automation framework is meticulously crafted to test the functionality of an e-commerce website using Java. The framework seamlessly integrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, robust design patterns, and follows industry-best practices such as Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), and consistent naming conventions. The implementation adheres to good programming practices, eliminating bad practices like code duplication, static sleeps, hardcoding, and non-atomic tests.

## Features

- **Cross-browser Testing**: Supports multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) for comprehensive testing.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Utilizes the POM design pattern for better code organization and maintenance.
- **Test Data Management**: Efficient handling of test data for different scenarios.
- **Parallel Execution**: Enables parallel execution of tests for faster feedback.
- **Configuration Management**: Easy configuration of browser settings, URLs, and other parameters.
