# E-commerce Selenium Test Automation Framework

## Overview

This Selenium-based test automation framework is meticulously crafted to test the functionality of an e-commerce website using Java. The framework seamlessly integrates key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, robust design patterns, and follows industry-best practices such as Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY), and consistent naming conventions. The implementation adheres to good programming practices, eliminating bad practices like code duplication, static sleeps, hardcoding, and non-atomic tests.
